\arguments{
\item{X}{a matrix (one-sample) or a list of matrices (multiple-samples), with each row representing an observation.}

\item{alpha}{significance level; default value: 0.05.}

\item{side}{either of \code{'lower','upper', or 'both'}; default value: 'both'.}

\item{tau}{real number(s) in the interval \code{[0,1)} that specifies the decay parameter and is automatically selected if it is set to \code{NULL} or multiple values are provided; default value: \code{NULL}, which is equivalent to \code{tau=1/(1+exp(-0.8*seq(-6,5,by=1))).}}

\item{B}{the number of bootstrap replicates; default value: \code{ceiling(50/alpha)}.}

\item{pairs}{a matrix with two columns, only used when there are more than two populations, where each row specifies a pair of populations for which the SCI is constructed; default value: \code{NULL}, so that SCIs for all pairs are constructed.}

\item{Sig}{a matrix (one-sample) or a list of matrices (multiple-samples), each of which is the covariance matrix of a sample; default value: \code{NULL}, so that it is automatically estimated from data.}

\item{verbose}{TRUE/FALSE, indicator of whether to output diagnostic information or report progress; default value: FALSE.}

\item{tau.method}{the method to select tau; possible values are 'MGB' (default), 'MGBA', 'RMGB', 'RMGBA', 'WB' and 'WBA' (see details).}

\item{nblock}{the number of block in CUDA computation}

\item{tpb}{number of threads per block; the maximum number of total number of parallel GPU threads is then \code{nblock*tpb}}

\item{seed}{the seed for random number generator}

\item{R}{the number of Monte Carlo replicates for estimating the empirical size; default: \code{ceiling(25/alpha)}}

\item{sci}{T/F, indicating whether to construct SCIs or not; default: FALSE.}

\description{
Construct (1-\code{alpha}) simultaneous confidence interval (SCI)  for the mean or difference of means of high-dimensional vectors.
}
\details{
Four methods to select the decay parameter \code{tau} are provided. Using the fact that a SCI is equivalent to a hypothesis test problem, all of them first identify a set of good candidates which give rise to test that respects the specified level \code{alpha}, and then select a candidate that minimizes the p-value. These methods differ in how to identify the good candidates.
    \describe{
        \item{\code{MGB}}{for this method, conditional on the data \code{X}, \code{B0=10*ceiling(1/alpha)} i.i.d. zero-mean multivariate Gaussian samples (called MGB samples here) are drawn, where the covariance of each sample is equal to the sample covariance matrix \code{Sig} of the data \code{X}. For each candidate value in \code{tau}, 1) the empirical distribution of the corresponding max/min statistic is obtained by reusing the same bootstrapped sample, 2) the corresponding p-value is obtained, and 3) the size is estimated by applying the test to all MGB samples. The candidate values with the empirical size closest to \code{alpha} are considered as good candidates.}
        \item{\code{MGBA}}{an slightly more aggressive version of \code{MGB}, where the candidate values with the estimated empirical size no larger than \code{alpha} are considered good candidates.}    
        \item{\code{RMGB}}{this method is similar to \code{MGB}, except that for each MGB sample, the covariance matrix is the sample covariance matrix of a resampled (with replacement) data \code{X}.}
        \item{\code{RMGBA}}{an slightly more aggressive version of \code{RMGB}, where the candidate values with the estimated empirical size no larger than \code{alpha} are considered good candidates.}
        \item{\code{WB}}{for this method, conditional on \code{X}, \code{B0=10*ceiling(1/alpha)} i.i.d. samples (called WB samples here) are drawn by resampling \code{X} with replacement. For each candidate value in \code{tau}, 1) the corresponding p-value is obtained, and 2) the size is estimated by applying the test to all WB samples without reusing the bootstrapped sample. The candidate values with the empirical size closest to \code{alpha} are considered as good candidates.}
        \item{\code{WBA}}{an slightly more aggressive version of \code{WB}, where the candidate values with the estimated empirical size no larger than \code{alpha} are considered good candidates.}
    }
    Among these methods, MGB and MGBA are recommended, since they are computationally more efficiently and often yield good performance. The MGBA might have slightly larger empirical size. The WB and WBA methods may be subject to outliers, in which case they become more conservative. The RMGB is computationally slightly slower than WB, but is less subject to outliers.
